# UK PMIP Runs
As communicated at the National Palaeoclimate Modelling Symposium at UCL in Sep 2025

### HadCM3
The Bristol contingent are aiming to submit HadCM3 to CMIP7. They will complete the DECK, Scenarios, DAMIP and PMIP

### UKESM1.2 
This model - also called UKESM-ice - has done the TIPMIP experiments. It is not planning to be formally submitted to CMIP7, but Leeds may also undertake the Palaeo TIPMIP simulation

### UKESM1.3
The Met Office has already started doing a lot of the DECK. UCL will explore doing the abrupt-127k experiment, but there is no desire to use this for other PMIP simulations

### HadGEM3-GC5-central
past2future have adopted this as their main UK model. Bristol will perform the lgm and Eocene. Leeds will do the latePliocene. BAS will do the abrupt-127k and lig127k. Someone will do the midHolocene.

### UKESM2
This model will be available from July 2026. ARCHER2 shuts down in Nov 2026. There are no immediate plans to undertake PMIP simulations with this model.
